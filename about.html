<h2>Saken Zholdas, Qazaq Republic brand: «Our goal is to dress the Olympic team of Kazakhstan»</h2>
<p>The history of the Qazaq Republic brand began with the fact that its founder Saken Zholdas did not join the criticism of the city logo approved by Akimat of Almaty, but offered his own and shared it on Facebook. Today this brand is chosen by well-known personalities — Dinara Satzhan, Alisher Elikbaev, Erlan Karin, Bagdat Mussin and other.</p>
<button class="accordion">Qazaq Republic brand</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Venera: You told that to the creation of the brand you were pushed by the support that the public on Facebook provided to the Almaty logo you developed. And before that, you faced the problem that we have almost no goods that symbolize the Kazakh culture, which could be taken as a gift abroad. This problem faced by everyone who leaves the country, but few who begins to produce such goods. How did you manage to develop this business?

Saken: I've always been fond of typography. When I posted the logo I developed and received feedback, that motivated me, but I would not have «started» if this my older sister Akmaral hadn't turned on the heat. She said that she would be engaged in the operational activities of the company — this is exactly what I do not like. I did creative part We are still working according to this scheme.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>Venera: I have a claim exactly to creativity. Why the choice of prints and colors is not so big? It seems that you stopped and have not released something new for a long time.

Saken: We initially did not want to fume about design. I am often offered to make New Year prints, or prints for March 8, but I adhere to minimalism: with the right supply, the value of our classic prints will rise. There are many brands in the world that adhere to a similar concept, such as Supreme or BAPE. Since the launch to this day, our most popular print is Born to Be Qazaq. The same with Qazaq Republic and Bari Jaqsy Bolady prints. Right now our team is working on a new collection you can buy in the spring. In addition, we actually have a good assortment. In addition to sweatshirts and t-shirts with prints, our company produces canvas bags, enameled and ceramic mugs, thermoses and all this with Kazakh identity. That is why I am sure these inscriptions won't get old but will reinforce its positions.</p>

  <p id="para">Venera: Are you not afraid that because of this the company will stop in its development?

Saken: We understand that the market needs to be constantly given something new. In our case, it will be the name of the goods. We want to produce baseball caps and jackets with inscriptions, which are already loved by many people. We are also going to expand the colour-grade.</p>
